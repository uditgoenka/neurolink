/**
 * Per-search retrieval planning.
 *
 * `RAGPipeline.query()` resolves four knobs — `topK`, `hybrid`, `graph`,
 * `rerank` — and every one of them is config with an optional per-call
 * override. Nothing inspects the query. The same plan is used for "what is
 * the refund window?" (one precise passage, an exact phrase worth matching
 * lexically) and "how does billing relate to entitlements?" (many passages,
 * relationships between documents).
 *
 * One decision request answers all four for the query in hand, in ~400ms.
 * Every answer is a *suggestion*: an explicit per-call option always wins,
 * and a capability the pipeline was not configured with can never be turned
 * on by a model — `graph: true` against a pipeline with no graph index would
 * be a failure, not a plan.
