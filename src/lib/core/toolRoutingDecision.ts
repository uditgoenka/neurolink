/**
 * Tool routing by decision model.
 *
 * The shipped router asks a generative model for `{servers: string[]}` on a
 * 15-second budget. That shape cannot express uncertainty: a server is in the
 * list or it is not, and the only recourse for a model that is unsure is to
 * include it. A decision model answers one yes/no question per server and
 * returns a *calibrated probability* for each, in one round trip of ~400ms
 * costing ~$0.00002.
 *
 * The asymmetry that follows is the whole point. Keeping a server that was not
 * needed costs a few hundred tokens of tool definitions. Dropping a server
 * that WAS needed costs the turn — the model cannot call a tool it was never
 * shown, and it has no way to ask for it back. So a server is excluded only on
 * a *confident no*; unanswered, mistyped and near-coin-flip answers all keep
 * it. This is the same reasoning as the classifier's asymmetric upgrade and
 * downgrade bars, applied to a different decision.
 *
 * Fail-open in every direction: returns `null` whenever the caller should
 * carry on as if this module did not exist.
 *

 * The question wording, and why it is this wording.
 *
 * The obvious phrasing — "answering this request will require calling at least
 * one tool from this server", with a `false` criterion reading "this server is
 * unrelated, OR the request needs no tool at all" — was measured against a
 * 10-request × 5-server labelled set. It separated correctly but weakly:
 * unrelated servers averaged p=0.31 and reached 0.80, so at the 0.6 drop bar
 * only 12 of 39 unneeded servers were dropped.
 *
 * Naming the server, asking in the present tense about what carrying out the
 * request *involves*, and splitting the bundled `false` criterion into a single
 * claim moved unrelated servers to a mean of p=0.03 with a maximum of 0.35 —
 * **37 of 39** dropped at the same bar, still with zero wrong drops.
 *
 * The lesson generalises: a decision model reads literally, and an `or` in a
 * criterion is two questions wearing one coat.
