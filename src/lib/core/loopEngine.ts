/**
 * Run one tool call under its deadline, cancelling it rather than abandoning it.
 *
 * The signal handed to `execute` is a controller owned by THIS call, not the
 * turn's — the deadline aborts it. A tool that honours its signal is therefore
 * told to stop when its time is up, instead of being left running while the
 * loop records that it failed: a terminal outcome reported for something that
 * has not terminated, still holding its resources and, for a side-effecting
 * tool, still applying its effect after the model was told it did not. A retry
 * would then start a second copy alongside the first.
 *
 * What this cannot do is stop a tool that ignores its signal. Nothing in this
 * process can; the loop stops waiting and the call runs on. That limit is
 * stated in `toolTimeoutMs`'s own documentation rather than left implied.
 *
 * The turn's abort is forwarded into the same controller, so cancelling a turn
 * reaches an in-flight tool exactly as it did before. Only the deadline is
 * raced — a turn-level abort still lets the call settle on its own terms.
 *
 * `null` means the caller opted out of the bound: the call is awaited
 * unguarded, with the turn's own signal, which is what the loops that never
 * had a per-tool timer did.
