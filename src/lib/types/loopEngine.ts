/**
 * DESIGN DECISION — mid-turn tool-discovery hydration (Plan 08 blocker 2,

 * override would let an adapter replace the engine's entire per-call
 * dispatch — breaker bookkeeping, execution, toolExecutions aggregation — so
 * every adapter needing hydration would have to reimplement that bookkeeping,
 * and any later engine-level fix to dispatch would silently not apply to the
 * adapters using the override. `resolveToolOnMiss` plugs into the existing
 * dispatch at the one decision point that needs a second lookup, leaving
 * breaker bookkeeping, retries and aggregation engine-owned for every
 * provider, hydrated or not.
 *
 * DESIGN DECISION — originalNameMap propagation (blocker 3): needs ZERO
 * engine or type change. Google's function-name sanitization is a translation
 * concern between the wire (sanitized names out, sanitized names back on
 * tool_call.name) and the engine's shape, which only ever sees plain string
 * names. An adapter that needs the map threads it as a constructor-time
 * closure and translates inside its own `executeStep` /
 * `buildToolResultMessages`, before those names cross the engine boundary.
 *
 * DESIGN DECISION — reserved-step + forced finalization (blocker 1, part 2):
 * stays OUTSIDE `runAgenticLoop`, in Vertex+Claude's own wrapper around
 * `resultPromise`. The reserved step needs no engine change at all — an
 * adapter declaring `maxSteps: requested - 1` means the engine's own loop
 * never touches the reserved slot. The forced call is a one-shot action taken
 * on the RESULT of a turn, not a repeatable step within one, so folding it in
 * would teach the engine a family-specific concept (forced tool_choice, a
 * distinguished terminal tool name) that every other adapter would then carry
 * and never set.
 *
 * DESIGN DECISION — terminal tool-call marking (blocker 1, part 1): needs
 * ZERO engine or type change. An adapter treats a detected terminal call as
 * terminal by omitting it from `toolCalls` and putting its parsed payload in
 * `text`. The engine already ends a turn the moment a step yields zero tool
 * calls, so such a step is indistinguishable from an ordinary final text
 * turn: never looked up in `options.tools`, never reaching TOOL_NOT_FOUND,
 * never counted against the breaker. Proven by a case in the loop-engine
 * suite rather than asserted here.

   * The turn-level timers do not cover this: a per-request deadline bounds one
   * model call and is disposed when the step settles, and the step cap only
   * advances when a step completes. Between two steps, a tool that never
   * returns has nothing watching it, and a turn that opted out of a lifetime
   * ceiling then hangs forever. A tool that exceeds the bound is told to stop
   * — the signal it was handed is aborted — and fails with an error tool
   * result costing one step, exactly as it does on the native generate path.
   *
   * `null` restores the behaviour of a loop with no per-tool timer at all:
   * `execute` is awaited unguarded, with the turn's own signal. Callers that
   * relied on unbounded tool execution say so with it. The one combination
   * refused is `null` together with `executionControl.lifetimeTimeoutMs: null`
   * — that would leave the turn with no bound anywhere.
   *
   * Callers that already guard their executors (Vertex and the Gemini
   * adapters, via `guardToolExecutor`) should pass the SAME value they gave
   * those guards, so this backstop can never be tighter than what the caller
   * asked for.
