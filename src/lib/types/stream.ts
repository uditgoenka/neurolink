   * - **It cannot be combined with `turnTimeoutMs`** when it sets
   *   `lifetimeTimeoutMs`, because both name the turn's wall-clock ceiling and
   *   only one of them can win. Supplying both is rejected up front rather
   *   than resolved in silence.
   * - **`lifetimeTimeoutMs: null` cannot be combined with
   *   `toolTimeoutMs: null`.** Removing the turn's ceiling leaves the per-tool
