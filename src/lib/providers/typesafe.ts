 * parsing are shared with every decision provider in
 * {@link SystemOneDecisionProvider}; this class holds only what is TypeSafe's.

 * of auto-select and the health sweep.
 *
 * Two measured properties shape the API: latency is flat in question count
 * (1 question 393ms, 400 questions 465ms) while concurrent requests queue.
 * Callers therefore batch every question into one `decide()` call.
 *
 * Two transports reach the same model. The direct one is TypeSafe's own API,
 * billed against a TypeSafe key. The gateway one is Vercel's AI Gateway
 * evaluation-model route, billed against a Vercel account — useful to a host
 * that already has one and does not want a second vendor relationship. They
 * differ on the wire (vocabulary, where the model is named, and where
 * `confidence` is reported) and not at all in `DecisionResult`.
