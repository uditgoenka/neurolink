/**
 * Direct Anthropic's adapter onto the shared agentic loop engine.
 *
 * Everything here is the wire-format half of the turn: building one Messages
 * request, folding an SSE event sequence into content blocks, serializing tool
 * results back into the conversation, and mapping the stop reason. The turn
 * loop, the step cap, tool dispatch, retry and usage accumulation belong to
 * `runAgenticLoop`.
 *
 * Two behaviours here are easy to lose in a migration and are called out
 * because losing either is silent:
 *
 *  - Thinking deltas ride the channel as `{ content: "", reasoning }`. The
 *    engine's chunk type carries `reasoning` for exactly this reason; a
 *    channel that only understood `content` would drop every thinking delta
 *    while the text path kept working.
 *  - `resolveToolOnMiss` is wired to real deferred-catalog hydration, not as
 *    interface decoration. The pre-migration loop resolves every tool call as
 *    `toolsRecord[name] ?? resolveDeferredTool(toolsRecord, name)`, which is
 *    how a cataloged tool the model calls without having loaded it via
 *    `search_tools` gets found. Dropping it would break those tools with a
 *    "Tool not found" that looks like a hallucination.
