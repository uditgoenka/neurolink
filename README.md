**The pipe layer for the AI nervous system.**

AI intelligence flows as streams — tokens, tool calls, memory, voice, documents.
NeuroLink is the vascular layer that carries these streams from where they are
generated (LLM providers: the neurons) to where they are needed (connectors: the organs).

```typescript
import { NeuroLink } from "@juspay/neurolink";

const pipe = new NeuroLink();

// Everything is a stream
const result = await pipe.stream({ input: { text: "Hello" } });
for await (const chunk of result.stream) {
  if ("content" in chunk) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.content);
  }
}

// Or skip text entirely: a calibrated decision, not a token stream
const decision = await pipe.tryDecide({
  // null if no decision provider is set
  state: { ticket: "Refund request, $42, first occurrence" },
  questions: {
    autoApprove: {
      type: "boolean",
      instructions: "Approve without human review.",
    },
  },
});
// decision?.answers.autoApprove.probability -> 0.91
```

## 🧠 What is NeuroLink?

**NeuroLink is the pipe layer of an AI nervous system.** Providers — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS, Azure, Mistral, local runtimes like Ollama, and dozens more — are the neurons: each generates a different kind of intelligence, at a different cost and latency. NeuroLink is the vascular layer that carries that intelligence, as a stream, to the applications — the organs — that consume it, across three inference types: `generate` and `stream` produce text, `decide` produces a calibrated `boolean`/`choice`/`score` judgment instead. A curated model registry (64 models, 132 aliases) backs metadata, routing, and context-window checks out of the box, and hundreds more models are reachable through aggregator providers — 100+ via LiteLLM, 300+ via OpenRouter.

Extracted from production systems at Juspay, NeuroLink provides a practical, TypeScript-first way to plug any application into that nervous system. Switch which neuron answers a request with a single parameter change — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock, Azure, a local runtime, or any provider you add. `decide` is the third inference type — a typed, calibrated judgment instead of text — for the model-routing and gating decisions `generate`/`stream` were never meant to make, powered by a purpose-built decision model (TypeSafe Jev, or the open-weights Laya) rather than a general-purpose LLM: with Jev, routing decisions land in ~400ms for about $0.00002, instead of a full generation call.

**Why NeuroLink?** Three genuine inference types, not one dressed up three ways — `generate` and `stream` produce text; `decide` produces a calibrated `boolean`/`choice`/`score` judgment, and which types a provider serves is declared per-provider via `inferenceKinds` rather than inferred from behavior. Every neuron plugs into the same pipe, including 3 fully local runtimes (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp) with per-request credential overrides, and MCP support covers all 4 transports (stdio, HTTP, SSE, WebSocket). Every AI-driven optimization the pipe performs — model routing, context compaction, tool selection — fails open: no key configured behaves exactly like NeuroLink without it, and routing uses asymmetric confidence thresholds (upgrade at 0.3, downgrade at 0.6) rather than a single cutoff, because a wrong downgrade costs more than a wrong upgrade. Switch providers with a single parameter change, leverage built-in tools plus any MCP-compliant tool server, deploy with confidence using enterprise features like Redis memory and multi-provider failover, and optimize costs automatically with intelligent routing. Use it via our professional CLI or TypeScript SDK—whichever fits your workflow.

**Where we're headed:** We're building for the future of AI—edge-first execution and continuous streaming architectures that make AI practically free and universally available. **[Read our vision →](docs/about/vision.md)**

| **`decide` Inference Type + TypeSafe Jev + Laya**       | next              | A third inference type alongside `generate`/`stream`: typed, calibrated judgments (`boolean`, `choice`, `score`) via `neurolink.decide()` / `tryDecide()`, one parallel pass (~400ms and ~$0.00002/decision on Jev). First provider is TypeSafe Jev (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, also reachable via the Vercel AI Gateway); [Laya](docs/getting-started/providers/laya.md) (`LAYA_API_KEY` + `LAYA_BASE_URL`), an open-weights model you run yourself, is the second — TypeSafe wins when both are configured. Used internally for model routing, context budgeting, relevance compaction and tool routing — fail-open and a no-op without a key. Per-query RAG planning is opt-in via `RAGPipeline`. | [Decide Guide](docs/features/decide-inference-type.md)                                                                                  |

## Decide: Calibrated Judgments, Not Text

**NeuroLink now supports decision models — a third inference type, with two
providers today: a hosted one and an open-weights one you can run yourself.**

`decide` sits alongside `generate` and `stream`. Instead of tokens, a decision
model takes one `state` plus a map of named typed questions and returns one
typed, **calibrated** answer per question, all in a single parallel pass — no
text output anywhere, so nothing has to be parsed back out of prose.

Public API: `neurolink.decide()` and the fail-open `neurolink.tryDecide()`
(returns `null` instead of throwing). This is a **TypeScript SDK surface** —
there is no `neurolink decide` CLI command today.

| Primitive | Answer shape                                                                           | Use it for                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `boolean` | A probability, 0–1 (no confidence of its own — gate on distance from 0.5)              | Yes/no gates: approve, drop, include, flag                          |
| `choice`  | An option + the full probability distribution + a confidence                           | Routing to one of N options — the distribution also **ranks** all N |
| `score`   | A probability-weighted index into an ordered rubric + a confidence, **and a `legend`** | Position on a scale: severity, priority, quality tier               |

A `score` is probability-weighted, so it can land **between** rubric levels —
useful for sorting a queue, not just bucketing it.

### What you can build with it

The model is fast, cheap and calibrated, but ~68% accurate (see the trade-off
below). That combination fits work that is **batched, gated and reversible** —
where a wrong answer is caught by a threshold or a human, not shipped to a user.

| Use case                           | Primitive                        | Why it fits                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ticket / helpdesk triage**       | `choice` team + `score` priority | `ranked` gives a fallback team order; a human still sees the ticket          |
| **Content moderation, first pass** | one `boolean` per item           | Only a confident "yes" auto-hides; everything else escalates                 |
| **Lead or severity queues**        | `score` over an ordered rubric   | The between-levels score sorts a queue rather than bucketing it              |
| **Shortlisting & reranking**       | one `choice` over N candidates   | One request ranks the whole catalogue — SKUs, canned replies, search results |
| **Your own model-tier gate**       | `boolean` or `choice`            | Decide cheap-vs-capable per message before you call a text model             |
| **Spam / fraud pre-screen**        | `boolean` with asymmetric bars   | A high bar to auto-reject, a lower one to flag for review                    |

**Do not use it for** a final answer a user reads, an irreversible action with no
confirmation step, or anything needing a rationale — a decision carries a
probability, never an explanation. Those belong to `generate`.

### Enabling it

Set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` — that one env var is the whole switch.
[TypeSafe Jev](https://console.typesafe.ai/keys) is the first decision provider
(`AIProviderName.TYPESAFE`, aliases `jev` / `typesafe-ai`). It is also reachable
through the **Vercel AI Gateway** via `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`; force one transport
with `TYPESAFE_TRANSPORT=direct|gateway`. Per-request credentials work as they do
for every other provider.

[**Laya**](docs/getting-started/providers/laya.md) is the second decision
provider — Convai Innovations' Apache-2.0, open-weights "System One" model, for
when you'd rather run the decision model on your own infrastructure than call a
hosted one. There is no built-in endpoint: set `LAYA_API_KEY` and
`LAYA_BASE_URL` to point at a Laya server you run yourself, or a LiteLLM proxy
with a pass-through route to one (or pass `credentials.laya` to
`new NeuroLink({ credentials })`, or per call). Its encoders read a much
shorter state than TypeSafe's — about 768 tokens on the default
`typed-decisions` checkpoint (320 on `english`/`auto`), against TypeSafe's
~33,000 — so it fits short, structured decisions rather than long context.
Every built-in consumer below asks for the first configured decision provider,
and TypeSafe is listed first: with both configured, TypeSafe runs; with only
Laya's key and base URL set, Laya runs.

```typescript
import {
  NeuroLink,
  readDecisionChoice,
  gateDecisionBoolean,
} from "@juspay/neurolink";

const neurolink = new NeuroLink();

const result = await neurolink.tryDecide({
  state: { ticket: "Customer reports a failed $42 payment, first occurrence." },
  questions: {
    team: {
      type: "choice",
      instructions: "Which team should handle this?",
      criteria: { billing: "Payments", technical: "Bugs", sales: "Pricing" },
    },
    autoRefund: {
      type: "boolean",
      instructions: "Approve the refund without human review.",
    },
  },
});

const team = result && readDecisionChoice(result.answers, "team");
if (team && team.confidence > 0.7) {
  route(team.choice); // team.ranked is the full ordering, not just the winner
}

// A boolean has no confidence of its own, so gate on BOTH the probability and
// its distance from a coin flip. `undefined` means "not sure" — not "no".
const refund = result && gateDecisionBoolean(result.answers, "autoRefund");
if (refund === true) autoRefund();
else queueForHuman();
```

### Where NeuroLink uses it itself

**Five `decide()` calls across the codebase**, each fail-open and a no-op
without a key — so nothing changes in its absence:

Worth being precise about two of these, because the grouping is easy to
misread:

- **Call 1 is a single request that does the work of three features.** Model
  routing, the registry-derived catalogue and the per-request
  `compactionThreshold` all read different answers out of the _same_ call —
  the context budget is not a second round trip, and `modelCatalog.ts` never
  calls `decide()` at all; it renders the candidate lines that call 1's model
  question chooses between. That is the batch-never-fan-out rule applied to
  NeuroLink's own code.
- **Call 5 is opt-in wiring, not automatic.** Per-query planning lives in
  `RAGPipeline`, which the `rag: { files }` shortcut on `generate()`/`stream()`
  does not construct. Build a `RAGPipeline` yourself and pass a decide function
  to get it; the shortcut path is unchanged.

Every one goes through the same `decide()` / `tryDecide()` core, so each gets
telemetry **even on failure** — a dedicated `model.decision` span, never folded
into generation metrics. That matters because a decision path that has silently
stopped working (rate-limited, timed out, provider down) would otherwise look
identical to one that was never configured; the span is what tells the two
apart.

### What it costs, and its limits

Measured against the live API — don't extrapolate past these:

- Latency is flat in question count: 1 question ~393ms, 400 questions ~465ms. Concurrent requests **queue**, so batch every question into one call — never fan out.
- ~$0.042 per million input tokens, output reported but billed at zero — about **$0.00002 per decision**.
- Two input ceilings: `state` + the longest single question ≈ 33,000 tokens; `state` + all questions ≈ 64,000 tokens.
- **Accuracy is the trade-off**: ~68% on TypeSafe's own 711-case benchmark vs. ~73% for a frontier model (TypeSafe's published figures, not our measurement). Use it for decisions that are **gated and reversible** — routing, dropping, budgeting — never for a final answer a user will see.

## 📚 Quick Start Guide

This guide will have you generating AI responses in under 5 minutes using either the SDK or CLI.

### Installation

Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install @juspay/neurolink

# pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add @juspay/neurolink

# yarn
yarn add @juspay/neurolink

# CLI only (no installation needed)
npx @juspay/neurolink --help
```

### Configuration

NeuroLink works with a broad set of AI providers — and local runtimes that need no API key at all. You'll need at least one to get started:

**Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)**

```bash
# Run the setup wizard to configure providers
pnpm dlx @juspay/neurolink setup
```

The wizard will guide you through:

- Selecting your preferred AI providers
- Validating API keys
- Setting up configuration files

**Option 2: Manual Configuration**

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Choose one or more providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=...
```

**Free Tier Options:**

- **Google AI Studio**: Get a free API key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)
- **Mistral AI**: Free tier available at [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai)
- **Ollama**: 100% free local models (requires [Ollama installation](https://ollama.ai))

### Your First API Call (SDK)

**Basic Text Generation:**

```typescript
import { NeuroLink } from "@juspay/neurolink";

// Initialize (auto-selects best available provider from your .env)
const neurolink = new NeuroLink();

// Generate a response
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms" },
});

console.log(result.content);
```

**Streaming Responses:**

```typescript
// Stream tokens in real-time
const stream = await neurolink.stream({
  input: { text: "Write a haiku about code" },
});
for await (const chunk of stream.stream) {
  if ("content" in chunk) process.stdout.write(chunk.content);
}
```

**Multimodal Input (Images + Text):**

```typescript
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: {
    text: "What's in this image?",
    images: ["./photo.jpg"],
  },
});
```

**Using Tools:**

```typescript
// Built-in tools are automatically available
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: {
    text: "What time is it and what files are in the current directory?",
  },
  // AI can call getCurrentTime and listDirectory tools
});
```

### Your First API Call (CLI)

**Basic Generation:**

```bash
# Simple text generation
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "Explain TypeScript generics"

# Specify provider and model
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "Hello!" --provider openai --model gpt-4o

# Stream responses
npx @juspay/neurolink stream "Write a story about AI" --provider anthropic
```

**Multimodal Input:**

```bash
# Analyze images
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "Describe this image" --image photo.jpg

# Process PDFs
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "Summarize this document" --pdf report.pdf

# Combine multiple file types
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "Analyze this data" --file data.xlsx --file config.json
```

**Interactive Loop Mode:**

```bash
# Start an interactive session with persistent context
npx @juspay/neurolink loop

# Inside loop mode:
> set provider anthropic
> set model claude-opus-4
> generate "Hello, Claude!"
> history  # View conversation history
> exit
```

### Common Use Cases

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**

```typescript
// Automatically chunk, embed, and search documents
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "What are the key features mentioned in the documentation?" },
  rag: {
    files: ["./docs/guide.md", "./docs/api.md"],
    chunkSize: 512,
    topK: 5,
  },
});
```

**Structured Output with Zod:**

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: {
    text: "Extract user info: John Doe, 30 years old, john@example.com",
  },
  schema,
  output: { format: "json" },
});

// Parse the structured JSON from result.content
const parsed = schema.parse(JSON.parse(result.content));
console.log(parsed); // { name: "John Doe", age: 30, email: "john@example.com" }
```

**External MCP Servers (GitHub, Slack, etc.):**

```typescript
// Connect to GitHub MCP server
await neurolink.addExternalMCPServer("github", {
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  transport: "stdio",
  env: { GITHUB_TOKEN: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN },
});

// AI can now interact with GitHub
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: 'Create an issue titled "Bug: login fails"' },
});
```

- Run `npx @juspay/neurolink setup` or add provider API key to `.env`

**Issue: Rate limit errors**

- Configure multiple providers for redundancy — NeuroLink auto-selects the best available
- Use `provider: "litellm"` with LiteLLM to proxy across many providers

**Issue: Large context overflows**

- Enable conversation memory with compaction: `new NeuroLink({ conversationMemory: { enabled: true } })`
- Use `rag` option to search documents instead of sending full content

### 🤖 AI Provider Integration

**Provider neurons behind one API** - Switch providers with a single parameter change. Nearly all serve `generate`/`stream`; TypeSafe Jev and Laya serve `decide` instead. Tool support: 31 native tool-calling, 3 model-dependent, 10 that serve no tools at all (embedding-, media- and decision-only). 3 are fully local runtimes (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp) and 4 need zero configuration to start (those three plus LiteLLM) — no cloud account, no API key. 9 providers (OpenAI, Google AI Studio, Google Vertex, Amazon Bedrock, Cohere, Ollama, LiteLLM, Voyage, Jina) expose `embed()`/`embedMany()` natively for RAG and custom vector search.

**Decision-only providers:** **TypeSafe Jev** (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`) and **Laya** (`LAYA_API_KEY` + `LAYA_BASE_URL`) do not appear in the table above because neither serves `generate`/`stream` — they are the two providers for the `decide` inference type, TypeSafe first when both are configured.

**External MCP servers** — connect any MCP-compliant server via `neurolink mcp add`; 9 popular servers (GitHub, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Filesystem, Git, Brave Search, Puppeteer, Memory, Bitbucket) ship with ready-made configs:

```typescript
// stdio transport - local MCP servers via command execution
await neurolink.addExternalMCPServer("github", {
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  transport: "stdio",
  env: { GITHUB_TOKEN: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN },
});

// HTTP transport - remote MCP servers via URL
await neurolink.addExternalMCPServer("github-copilot", {
  transport: "http",
  url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_COPILOT_TOKEN" },
  timeout: 15000,
  retries: 5,
});

// Tools automatically available to AI
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: 'Create a GitHub issue titled "Bug in auth flow"' },
});
```

**MCP Transport Options:**

| Transport   | Use Case       | Key Features                                    |

| **Markup**    | HTML, SVG, Markdown, Text                                                              | OWASP-compliant sanitization                                        |
| **Code**      | 50+ languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, etc.)                                     | Language detection, syntax metadata                                 |
| **Config**    | `.env`, `.ini`, `.toml`, `.cfg`                                                        | Secure parsing                                                      |
| **Media**     | Images (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF), PDFs, CSV                                               | Provider-specific formatting                                        |
| **Audio**     | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.ogg`, `.flac`, `.webm`                                       | Automatic transcription + duration metadata                         |
| **Video**     | `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.avi`                                                | Keyframe extraction, metadata, embedded subtitles                   |
| **Archive**   | `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.tgz`, `.bz2`, `.tbz2`, `.jar`, `.xz`, `.txz`, `.zst`, `.tzst` | Entry listing, nested text extraction                               |

```typescript
// Process any supported file type
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: {
    text: "Analyze this data and code",
    files: [
      "./data.xlsx", // Excel spreadsheet
      "./config.yaml", // YAML configuration
      "./diagram.svg", // SVG (injected as sanitized text)
      "./main.py", // Python source code
    ],
  },
});

// CLI: Use --file for any supported type
// neurolink generate "Analyze this" --file ./report.xlsx --file ./config.json
```

Audio and video attach the same way. Audio is transcribed automatically before
the model sees it; video is reduced to keyframes plus metadata and any embedded
subtitle track:

```typescript
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: {
    text: "What was decided in this meeting, and who owns each action item?",
    files: [
      "./standup.mp3", // transcribed, then folded into the prompt
      "./demo.mp4", // keyframes + duration/codec metadata + subtitles
      "./deck.pptx", // slides and speaker notes
    ],
  },
});
```

```bash
# Same thing from the CLI
neurolink generate "Summarize this recording" --file ./standup.mp3
neurolink generate "Describe what happens" --file ./demo.mp4
```

> Audio transcription needs a provider with a speech model configured (OpenAI
> Whisper by default). Video keyframe extraction requires `ffmpeg` — install it
> separately or rely on the bundled `ffmpeg-static`.

**Key Features:**

- **ProcessorRegistry** - Priority-based processor selection with fallback
- **OWASP Security** - HTML/SVG sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- **Auto-detection** - FileDetector identifies file types by extension and content
- **Provider-agnostic** - Processors work across supported AI providers

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Distributed Memory** | Share conversation context across instances  | Horizontal scaling          |
| **Session Export**     | Export full history as JSON                  | Analytics, debugging, audit |
| **Auto-Detection**     | Automatic Redis discovery from environment   | Zero-config in containers   |
| **Graceful Failover**  | Falls back to in-memory if Redis unavailable | High availability           |
| **TTL Management**     | Configurable session expiration              | Memory management           |

### Quick Setup

```typescript
import { NeuroLink } from "@juspay/neurolink";

// Auto-detect Redis from REDIS_URL environment variable
const neurolink = new NeuroLink({
  conversationMemory: {
    enabled: true,
    enableSummarization: true,
  },
});

// Or explicit Redis configuration
const neurolinkExplicit = new NeuroLink({
  conversationMemory: {
    enabled: true,
    redisConfig: {
      host: "redis.example.com",
      port: 6379,
      password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
      ttl: 86400, // 24-hour session expiration (seconds)
    },
  },
});

// Retrieve conversation history for analytics
const history = await neurolink.getConversationHistory("session-id");
await saveToDataWarehouse(history);
```

### Docker Quick Start

```bash
# Start Redis
docker run -d --name neurolink-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Configure NeuroLink
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

## Revolutionary Interactive CLI

NeuroLink's CLI goes beyond simple commands - it's a **full AI development environment**:

### Why Interactive Mode Changes Everything

| Feature       | Traditional CLI   | NeuroLink Interactive          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Session State | None              | Full persistence               |
| Memory        | Per-command       | Conversation-aware             |
| Configuration | Flags per command | `/set` persists across session |
| Tool Testing  | Manual per tool   | Live discovery & testing       |
| Streaming     | Optional          | Real-time default              |

## CLI & SDK Essentials

`neurolink` CLI mirrors the SDK so teams can script experiments and codify them later.

```bash
# Discover available providers and models
npx @juspay/neurolink status
npx @juspay/neurolink models list --provider google-ai

# Route to a specific provider/model
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "Summarize customer feedback" \
  --provider azure --model gpt-4o-mini

# Turn on analytics + evaluation for observability
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "Draft release notes" \
  --enable-analytics --enable-evaluation --format json

# RAG: Ask questions about your docs (auto-chunks, embeds, searches)
npx @juspay/neurolink generate "What are the key features?" \
  --rag-files ./docs/guide.md ./docs/api.md --rag-strategy markdown

# Claude proxy + local OpenObserve dashboard
npx @juspay/neurolink proxy setup
npx @juspay/neurolink proxy telemetry setup
npx @juspay/neurolink proxy status --format json
```

```typescript
import { NeuroLink } from "@juspay/neurolink";

const neurolink = new NeuroLink({
  conversationMemory: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  enableOrchestration: true,
});

const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: {
    text: "Create a comprehensive analysis",
    files: [
      "./sales_data.csv", // Auto-detected as CSV
      "examples/data/invoice.pdf", // Auto-detected as PDF
      "./diagrams/architecture.png", // Auto-detected as image
      "./report.xlsx", // Auto-detected as Excel
      "./config.json", // Auto-detected as JSON
      "./diagram.svg", // Auto-detected as SVG (injected as text)
      "./app.ts", // Auto-detected as TypeScript code
    ],
  },
  provider: "vertex", // PDF-capable provider (see docs/features/pdf-support.md)
  enableEvaluation: true,
  region: "us-east-1",
});

console.log(result.content);
console.log(result.evaluation?.overallScore);

// RAG: Ask questions about your documents
const answer = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "What are the main architectural decisions?" },
  rag: {
    files: ["./docs/architecture.md", "./docs/decisions.md"],
    strategy: "markdown",
    topK: 5,
  },
});
console.log(answer.content); // AI searches your docs and answers
```

### Gemini 3 with Extended Thinking

```typescript
import { NeuroLink } from "@juspay/neurolink";

const neurolink = new NeuroLink();

// Use Gemini 3 with extended thinking for complex reasoning
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: {
    text: "Solve this step by step: What is the optimal strategy for...",
  },
  provider: "vertex",
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  thinkingConfig: {
    thinkingLevel: "medium", // Options: "minimal", "low", "medium", "high"
  },
});

console.log(result.content);
```

## Platform Capabilities at a Glance

| Capability               | Highlights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Provider unification** | Provider neurons behind one API, with automatic fallback, cost-aware routing, `providerFallback` policy, `modelChain` config.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Decision inference**   | Third inference type (`decide`) alongside generate/stream: calibrated `boolean`/`choice`/`score` judgments via TypeSafe Jev (~400ms flat, ~$0.00002/decision) or Laya, a self-hosted open-weights alternative. Used internally for model routing, context budgeting, relevance compaction and tool routing; per-query RAG planning is opt-in via `RAGPipeline`. |
| **Multimodal pipeline**  | Stream images + CSV data + PDF documents across providers with local/remote assets. Auto-detection for mixed file types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
