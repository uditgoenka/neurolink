/**
 * Continuous Test Suite — nl.stream() toolsUsed/toolExecutions telemetry.
 *
 * Regression coverage for a shared-layer defect: `nl.stream()`'s returned
 * `StreamResult` silently dropped `toolsUsed` and `toolExecutions` even when
 * a tool genuinely ran during the stream, for every provider — because two
 * distinct code paths lose the fields on the way from the provider to the
 * caller:
 *
 *   1. `BaseProvider.stream()` (src/lib/core/baseProvider.ts) wraps a
 *      provider's raw StreamResult twice (`withStreamModelFallback`,
 *      `wrapStreamWithLifecycleCallbacks`) via a naked object spread
 *      (`{ ...result, stream: wrapped }`). A background-loop native provider
 *      (Vertex, Google AI Studio, and the OpenAI-chat-completions family used
 *      here) reports `toolExecutions` — and sometimes `toolsUsed` — via a
 *      `get`-only accessor that resolves lazily as the tool loop runs. A
 *      spread reads (and thereby snapshots and freezes) any getter on the
 *      source object before the consumer has pulled a single chunk, so the
 *      copy is permanently empty/absent.
 *   2. `NeuroLink`'s own stream orchestration (src/lib/neurolink.ts) rebuilds
 *      the final `StreamResult` at several return sites with a fixed,
 *      hand-written field list that never mentioned `toolsUsed` /
 *      `toolExecutions` at all — so even a value that survived (1) was
 *      dropped a second time before reaching the caller, for EVERY provider,
 *      not just the ones with getter-based telemetry.
 *
 * ## Why an OpenAI-compatible local fixture, not a live Bedrock/Vertex call
 *
 * The defect was confirmed against Bedrock and Vertex, but the fix lives
 * entirely in the two shared call paths above — every provider's `stream()`
 * funnels through both. `test/helpers/bedrockLocalEndpoint.ts` and
 * `test/helpers/openaiCompatibleLocalEndpoint.ts` (built for exactly this
 * kind of local-fixture testing) live on other, unmerged branches and are
 * not present in this worktree, and hand-rolling AWS's binary
 * `vnd.amazon.eventstream` Converse-Stream framing here would test the
 * fixture's encoder at least as much as NeuroLink. The OpenAI chat-completions
 * SSE wire format is itself a real, widely-implemented vendor format (it's
 * what `OpenAIProvider extends OpenAIChatCompletionsProvider` speaks over
 * raw `fetch`, no SDK indirection — see `openaiChatCompletionsBase.ts`), and
 * that provider reports `toolExecutions` via the exact same
 * `Object.defineProperty(result, "toolExecutions", { get: ... })` pattern
 * Vertex and Google AI Studio use. Driving a real two-request tool round
 * trip (tool-call delta → real local tool execution → follow-up completion)
 * through `new NeuroLink().stream()` against a local HTTP server therefore
 * exercises the identical shared BaseProvider-spread and NeuroLink-rebuild
 * code every provider's stream() passes through — without stubbing any
 * NeuroLink code and without live credentials.
 *
 * Self-contained: the local HTTP server is defined in this file, not
 * imported from a helper on another branch. Deterministic and free — no
 * network egress, no API key.
 *
 * ## Two additional sibling sites, same defect shape
 *
 * Two more return sites rebuild the StreamResult the identical, naked way
 * and are covered below alongside the case above:
 *
 *   3. `BaseProvider.executeFakeStreaming()` builds its return value from a
 *      hand-written field list that never mentioned `toolsUsed` /
 *      `toolExecutions`, even though it wraps a `generate()` result that
 *      carries both. It's reached whenever `stream()` detects 3+ image parts
 *      in the user message (`hasVideoFrames()` — deliberately vendor/model
 *      agnostic, so plain image uploads trigger it too, with no video or
 *      network-error injection required) and falls back to running the
 *      standard tool-calling `generate()` loop under a synthetic stream.
 *   4. `NeuroLink.streamWithIterationFallback()` (backing the public,
 *      documented `providerFallback` / `modelChain` StreamOptions) rebuilds
 *      its return value the same naked-spread way.
 *
 * Run: pnpm run build && pnpm run test:stream-tool-telemetry
