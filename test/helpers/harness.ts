/**
 * Canonical test harness for NeuroLink continuous-test suites.
 *
 * Replaces ~5,500 lines of boilerplate that was copy-pasted (and drifted)
 * across 37 hand-rolled test scripts. Every suite now reduces to:
 *
 *   import { defineSuite, ... } from "./helpers/harness.js";
 *   const { test, runSuite, opts } = defineSuite("My Suite");
 *   await test("does X", async () => { ... });
 *   await runSuite();
 *
 * Three-valued result reporting:
 *   - PASS: test fn returns/resolves normally
 *   - FAIL: test fn throws an Error not matching the SKIP convention
 *   - SKIP: test fn throws `new Skip(reason)`, OR throws an error whose
 *           message starts with "SKIP:", OR — in a live suite only — throws
 *           a known provider error caught by isExpectedProviderError()
 *           (e.g. missing API key, rate limit, quota exhausted). A suite
 *           declared `offline: true` has no upstream, so that third route
 *           is closed there and such an error is a FAIL.
 *
 * Provider/model resolution order:
 *   opts.provider (constructor) → --provider= argv → NEUROLINK_TEST_PROVIDER
 *     → TEST_PROVIDER env → undefined
 *   opts.model    (constructor) → --model= argv    → NEUROLINK_TEST_MODEL
 *     → TEST_MODEL env  → undefined
 *
 * Suites that legitimately need a different default (e.g. middleware uses
 * ollama by default) pass `{ defaultProvider: "ollama" }` to defineSuite.
 *
 * Per-test timeout budget scaling:
 *   `NEUROLINK_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE` multiplies every suite's resolved
 *   `perTestTimeoutMs` (default 240_000, or a suite's own override). It is
 *   unset by default, which resolves to a scale of 1 — today's fixed
 *   budgets, unchanged, on a local machine. Set it on a shared/loaded CI
 *   executor (e.g. `NEUROLINK_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE=2`) to widen every suite's
 *   wall-clock budget without editing suite source. Anything that does not
 *   parse as a finite number greater than 0 (unset, empty, non-numeric, or
 *   <= 0) falls back to 1. This only widens the budget; it does not and
 *   cannot tell a genuine hang apart from runner contention — see the
 *   offline-timeout message in `defineSuite` for why that distinction is
 *   left to the reader.

 * Bound one case from a suite that iterates its own `tests[]` array.
 *
 * `defineSuite`'s per-test timeout lives in the `test(name, fn)` helper it
 * hands back. A suite that instead keeps its own array and loops
 * `await test.fn()` never touches that helper, so its cases are UNBOUNDED —
 * `runSuite(body)` only awaits the body, it adds no timeout of its own. One
 * hung case then hangs the whole run until the CI job is killed, and the
 * report says nothing about which case it was.
 *
 * Rejects rather than resolving, so the suite's existing catch records a
 * failure for the named case. The message deliberately says "hang, not
 * slowness": a case that legitimately needs longer than this should be given
 * its own bound, not have this one raised.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT BOUND, because assuming otherwise is worse than having no
 * bound at all: anything that blocks the event loop. This is `Promise.race`,
 * so the timer only fires when the loop is free to run it. A case that calls
 * `spawnSync`, `execSync`, `readFileSync` on a slow device, or any other
 * synchronous blocking call is NOT protected — the rejection cannot be
 * delivered until the blocking call returns, and if it never returns, never.
 * Measured: a 300ms bound around a 3s `spawnSync` returned at 3025ms without
 * firing.
 *
 * The corollary matters more than the caveat. `spawnSync`'s own `timeout`
 * option is not a guarantee either: it sends `killSignal` (SIGTERM by default)
 * and keeps waiting, so a child that ignores SIGTERM hangs it forever. Every
 * `spawnSync` in a suite therefore needs `killSignal: "SIGKILL"` to be
 * bounded at all — this helper cannot supply that for you.
 *
 * `Promise.race` also does not CANCEL the losing promise. A case abandoned
 * here keeps running, so its `finally` has not executed: anything it mutated
 * globally is still mutated while later cases run. A case that patches a
 * global should scope the patch as narrowly as it can, precisely so that
 * window is harmless.
 *
 * `fn` returns `Promise<T> | T`, not `Promise<T>`, so that a suite whose case
 * type is the harness's own `TestFn` (`() => Promise<void> | void`) can be
 * bounded. The narrower signature rejected those at compile time — which is
 * safe, but it quietly left such suites unbounded, since the only way to keep
 * them compiling was not to wrap them. `continuous-test-suite-auth.ts` was
 * exactly that case.
 *
 * A synchronous `fn` is not a hazard here: `Promise.race` coerces a non-promise
 * to an immediately-resolved one, so a sync case simply wins its own race. It
 * also cannot hang except by blocking the event loop, which this helper already
 * documents as beyond what it can bound.
