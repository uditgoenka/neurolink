# Type Alias: DecisionCallerFn

> **DecisionCallerFn** = (`options`) => `Promise`\<[`DecisionResult`](DecisionResult.md) \| `null`\>

Injected fail-open decision caller — typically a bound `NeuroLink.tryDecide`,
which returns `null` on any failure rather than throwing.

Every internal consumer of the `decide` inference type takes one of these
instead of importing a provider, exactly as the tool router takes a
`generateFn`. It is what keeps the consumers provider-import-free, and what
makes "no decision provider configured" indistinguishable from "the call
failed" at every call site: both are `null`, and both mean _carry on as
before_.

The options carry a [DecisionSite](DecisionSite.md) stamp; a bound `tryDecide` routes
a stamped request through the host's [DecisionHooks](DecisionHooks.md).

## Parameters

### options

[`DecisionCallerOptions`](DecisionCallerOptions.md)

## Returns

`Promise`\<[`DecisionResult`](DecisionResult.md) \| `null`\>
