[NeuroLink API Reference](../README.md) / DecisionLimits

# Type Alias: DecisionLimits

> **DecisionLimits** = `object`

Input a decision provider can actually read, declared on its descriptor.

A request over either limit is refused before any network call with
`max_tokens_exceeded`, so no decision is ever made on input the model
silently cut off. Every internal consumer already treats that error as
"carry on as before".

## Properties

### maxStateTokens

> **maxStateTokens**: `number`

Estimated tokens of `state` (serialized first when it is not a string)
for any model NOT listed in `models` — an alias, a typo, a self-hosted
name — so it should be the tightest window the provider has.

---

### maxQuestions?

> `optional` **maxQuestions?**: `number`

Absent when the provider has no cap on questions per request.

---

### nonAsciiTokensPerChar?

> `optional` **nonAsciiTokensPerChar?**: `number`

Tokens charged per non-ASCII character. The default estimate assumes ~4
characters per token, which holds for English and is several times too
generous for other scripts on an English tokenizer. Absent = default
estimate for every character.

---

### models?

> `optional` **models?**: `Readonly`\<`Record`\<`string`, \{ `maxStateTokens`: `number`; `nonAsciiTokensPerChar?`: `number`; \}\>\>

Per-model limits, keyed by model id; each field overrides the one above.

---

### media?

> `optional` **media?**: [`DecisionMediaLimits`](DecisionMediaLimits.md)

What the provider accepts besides text. Absent means text only.

---

### advisory?

> `optional` **advisory?**: `boolean`

True when these figures describe the provider's own server-side ceiling,
published so callers can plan against it, and NeuroLink does NOT refuse
locally — the server does, with its own `max_tokens_exceeded`. Absent or
false means NeuroLink refuses an over-limit request before any network
call. `NeuroLink.decisionLimits()` reports the distinction as
`enforcedLocally`.
