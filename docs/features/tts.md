---

## Quick Start

### Installation

TTS support is built into NeuroLink. No additional installation required.

### Environment Setup

Set the appropriate environment variables for your chosen TTS provider:

```bash
# Google AI Studio (google-ai TTS uses the Google Cloud TTS SDK; ADC / service
# account is required — there is no API-key auth for the TTS handler itself)
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
# (GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY is used by the LLM/STT side of `google-ai`, not TTS.)

# Google Vertex AI (vertex) — service account recommended for production
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"

# OpenAI TTS (openai-tts)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# ElevenLabs (elevenlabs)
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-elevenlabs-api-key"

# Azure TTS (azure-tts)
export AZURE_SPEECH_KEY="your-azure-speech-key"
export AZURE_SPEECH_REGION="eastus"  # or your Azure region

# Fish Audio TTS (fish-audio) — low-cost, voice cloning, 14 languages
export FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY="your-fish-audio-api-key"

# Cartesia TTS (cartesia) — low-latency Sonic models, voice cloning
export CARTESIA_API_KEY="sk_car_..."
```

**Google API Key Configuration:**

If using API key authentication for Google, enable both APIs in Google Cloud Console:

1. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Create or select your API key
3. Under "API restrictions", enable:
   - **Generative Language API** (for Gemini)
   - **Cloud Text-to-Speech API** (for TTS)

### Basic Usage

**CLI:**

```bash
# Generate and play audio automatically
neurolink generate "Hello, world!" \
  --provider google-ai \
  --tts-voice en-US-Neural2-C

# Save to file
neurolink generate "Welcome to our application" \
  --provider google-ai \
  --tts-voice en-US-Neural2-C \
  --tts-output welcome.mp3
```

**SDK:**

```typescript
import { NeuroLink } from "@juspay/neurolink";

const neurolink = new NeuroLink();

const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "Hello, world!" },
  provider: "google-ai",
  tts: {
    enabled: true,
    voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
    format: "mp3",
    play: true, // Auto-play in CLI, manual in SDK
  },
});

// Access generated audio
console.log("Audio size:", result.audio?.size, "bytes");
console.log("Audio format:", result.audio?.format);
```

## Voice Selection

### Available Voice Types

Google Cloud TTS offers three voice quality tiers:

| Voice Type   | Quality | Cost   | Use Case                                | Example Voice      |
| ------------ | ------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Neural2**  | Highest | High   | Natural conversations, voice assistants | `en-US-Neural2-C`  |
| **Wavenet**  | High    | Medium | Professional narration, podcasts        | `en-US-Wavenet-D`  |
| **Standard** | Good    | Low    | Cost optimization, bulk generation      | `en-US-Standard-B` |

### Voice Discovery

`--tts-voice` takes a provider-specific identifier, and `neurolink voices`
prints the ones a provider will accept:

```bash
neurolink voices --provider openai-tts                  # the six OpenAI voices
neurolink voices --provider google-ai --language en-US  # filter by language
neurolink voices --provider elevenlabs --json           # machine-readable
```

`--provider` is required. The list is sorted by name and the count is printed
at the end. Providers are registered only when their credentials are present,
so an unconfigured provider is reported the same way a misspelled one is —
with the set that _is_ registered named in the message, and a non-zero exit.

The same list is available from the SDK:

```typescript
import { TTSProcessor } from "@juspay/neurolink";

const voices = await TTSProcessor.getVoices("google-ai", {
  languageCode: "en-US",
});
```

`languageCode` is passed through to the provider, which decides what filtering
it means: Google and Azure query their APIs with it, and OpenAI's fixed list
ignores it. An unregistered provider, or one whose handler does not implement
voice listing, raises a `TTS_PROVIDER_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.

Google voice identifiers follow Google Cloud TTS naming conventions: `<language>-<variant>-<type>-<name>` (e.g., `en-US-Neural2-C`, `en-GB-Wavenet-D`).

Refer to the [Google Cloud TTS voice list](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices) for all available voices.

### Supported Languages

**English Variants:**

- `en-US` - United States English
- `en-GB` - British English
- `en-AU` - Australian English
- `en-IN` - Indian English

**Other Languages:**

- `es-ES`, `es-US` - Spanish (Spain, Latin America)

### Voice Selection Guidelines

**For Natural Conversations:**

```typescript
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",  // Female, natural
  // OR
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-A",  // Male, natural
}
```

**For Professional Narration:**

```typescript
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Wavenet-D",  // Male, professional
  // OR
  voice: "en-GB-Wavenet-A",  // British, professional
}
```

**For Cost Optimization:**

```typescript
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Standard-B",  // Lower cost
}
```

## TTS Synthesis Modes

NeuroLink supports two TTS synthesis modes, selected with `tts.mode`:

| `tts.mode`           | What is spoken                    | Model call | `usage`   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| `"direct"` (default) | the input text / prompt, verbatim | none       | all zeros |
| `"response"`         | the model's generated reply       | yes        | real      |

`result.ttsMetadata.mode` reports which one ran. The older
`useAiResponse: true` flag still means `mode: "response"` and is still
honoured, but an explicit `mode` wins when both are present. `stream()`
always synthesizes the streamed reply and ignores `mode`.

### Mode 1: Direct Text-to-Speech (Default)

Converts input text directly to speech **without** AI generation.

```typescript
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "Welcome to our service!" },
  provider: "google-ai",
  tts: {
    enabled: true,
    mode: "direct", // Default: synthesize input text
    voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  },
});

// Audio contains: "Welcome to our service!"
// No AI generation occurs; result.ttsMetadata.mode === "direct"
```

> **Direct mode ignores LLM options.** Because no model is called, `tools`,
> `systemPrompt`, `conversationMessages`, `schema` and
> `conversationMemoryConfig` have no effect. If a request carries any of them
> without an explicit `tts.mode`, NeuroLink logs one warning naming the
> ignored options — the usual fix is `mode: "response"`. The request is never
> rejected, so existing "speak this text" callers are unaffected.

**Use cases:**

- Pre-written scripts
- System notifications
- Fixed announcements
- Voice confirmations

### Mode 2: AI Response Synthesis

Generates AI response first, then converts the response to speech.

```typescript
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "Tell me a joke" },
  provider: "google-ai",
  tts: {
    enabled: true,
    mode: "response", // Synthesize AI's response (legacy: useAiResponse: true)
    voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  },
});

// AI generates joke text
// TTS synthesizes the joke audio
// Both text and audio available in result; result.ttsMetadata.mode === "response"
```

> **Note:** when `mode: "response"`, NeuroLink synthesizes the chat
> provider's text response. If your chat provider has no TTS counterpart
> (e.g. `anthropic`, `bedrock`), set `tts.provider` explicitly — otherwise
> streaming continues as text-only and logs a provider-resolution warning.
> Chat providers that double as TTS handlers (e.g. `google-ai`, `vertex`)
> auto-resolve when `tts.provider` is omitted.

**Use cases:**

- Voice assistants
- Interactive AI conversations
- Dynamic content narration
- AI-powered podcasts

### Cleaning text for speech (`tts.sanitize`)

Model output is written for a screen. Read aloud, `**bold**` becomes
"asterisk asterisk", a URL is spelled out letter by letter, and an emoji is
announced by name. `tts.sanitize` runs the text through
`prepareTextForSpeech()` first:

```typescript
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "Summarise the release notes" },
  tts: { enabled: true, mode: "response", sanitize: true },
});
```

With `sanitize: true` the defaults apply; pass an object to tune them:

| Option            | Default                 | Effect                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `markdown`        | `true`                  | Strip headings, emphasis, inline code, bullets, blockquotes, HTML tags; tables become comma-separated rows; links → text |
| `codeBlocks`      | `"phrase"`              | Fenced code: `"phrase"` speaks `codeBlockPhrase`, `"drop"` removes it, `"keep"` reads the contents                       |
| `codeBlockPhrase` | `"Code block omitted."` | Spoken stand-in for a fenced block                                                                                       |
| `urls`            | `"hostname"`            | `https://docs.example.com/a/b` → `docs.example.com` (an IDN host in Unicode, not punycode); `"remove"` drops the URL     |
| `emoji`           | `true`                  | Remove emoji and pictographs with their skin-tone modifiers, variation selectors and the joiners between them            |

It is **off by default**: existing callers get byte-identical synthesis
input. The pass is careful about what it does not touch:

- Emphasis is a **pair** around a word run — `**bold**`, `*it*`, `_this_` — so
  an asterisk between digits is arithmetic and stays: `2*3*4 = 24` is spoken
  as written, as is `*123*1#`. Backslash escapes are resolved first and the
  escaped character is kept: `\*not bold\*` becomes `*not bold*`.
- Only real HTML tag names are stripped (`<b>`, `<br/>`, `<a href>`, …).
  Angle-bracketed placeholders such as `<Enter>` or `<order-id>`, generics
  and comparisons are left alone.
- The zero-width joiner is removed only between or beside pictographs; in
  Indic and Arabic text, where it shapes letters, it is kept.

In `stream()` the pass runs **per segment** with code blocks kept (fence lines
stripped), because a segment may hold an unterminated fence. Segments are cut
at sentence ends with no awareness of markdown spans, so a construct that
crosses a segment boundary — a link whose `](` lands in the next segment, an
emphasis run closed two sentences later — is not recognised and its markers
are spoken. Use `generate()` with `mode: "response"` when the whole reply must
be cleaned as one text. The function is exported for use on your own text:

```typescript
import { prepareTextForSpeech } from "@juspay/neurolink";

prepareTextForSpeech(
  "## Title\n\nSee **this** at https://docs.example.com/x 🎉",
);
// → "Title\n\nSee this at docs.example.com"
```

Every regular expression in the pass is linear-time, and every bounded span
excludes its own opener so a run of openers cannot walk the bound. Measured
on one machine (Node 24): 1 MB of ordinary markdown takes about 36 ms, and
the worst adversarial shapes — 1 MB of `[`, `![`, `**`, `<span ` or
`<http://` — each take 4–8 ms. Two of those numbers used to be much larger:
1 MB of `[` cost 2.6 s until the link-label class excluded `[`, and 1 MB of
`<http://` cost about 380 ms (a reviewer measured 0.5 s) until the autolink
target class excluded `<` — each unterminated opener had been walking the
full 2,048-character target bound before failing. Emphasis boundaries are
Unicode-aware (`\p{P}` / `\p{S}` around the delimiter run), so `**` is
stripped before a danda, a full-width colon, a curly quote or an em dash as
well as before ASCII punctuation, and the pair rule still leaves `2*3*4`,
`x**2` and `Dial *123*1#` alone. In `generate()` the pass is skipped for
input more than four times the provider's text cap, which `TTSProcessor`
rejects as `TTS_TEXT_TOO_LONG` either way, so an oversized input fails at
once rather than after a cleanup it could never pass.

## Audio Format Options

### Supported Formats

| Format       | Quality | File Size            | Platform Support | Use Case                       |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **MP3**      | Good    | Small (~100 KB/min)  | All platforms    | Default, balanced quality/size |
| **WAV**      | Best    | Large (~1 MB/min)    | All platforms    | Highest quality, editing       |
| **OGG/Opus** | Good    | Medium (~150 KB/min) | macOS, Linux     | Web streaming                  |

### Format Selection

```typescript
// Default: MP3 (balanced quality and size)
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  format: "mp3"  // Default
}

// Best quality: WAV
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  format: "wav"
}

// Web streaming: OGG
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  format: "ogg"
}
```

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**Windows:**

- Built-in playback only supports WAV format
- Auto-converts to WAV when `play: true` on Windows
- Use MP3 for file output, WAV for immediate playback

**macOS:**

- `afplay` (built-in) decodes every format — no setup needed.

**Linux:**

- **WAV** requires ALSA (`aplay`) or PulseAudio (`paplay`), but no compressed-format decoder.
- **Compressed formats (mp3/ogg/opus)** need a real decoder — NeuroLink tries `ffplay` (ffmpeg), then `mpv`, `mpg123` (mp3), then `cvlc` (VLC), in that order. Install any one of them.
- `paplay`/`aplay` **cannot** decode mp3, so with none of the above installed a default `--tts-play` (which defaults to mp3) will report a clear error naming the decoders — or use `--tts-format wav` when `aplay` or `paplay` is available.

## Voice Customization

### Speaking Rate

Control speech speed (0.25 to 4.0):

```typescript
// Slower (half speed)
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  speed: 0.5
}

// Normal speed (default)
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  speed: 1.0  // Default
}

// Faster (double speed)
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  speed: 2.0
}
```

**CLI:**

```bash
neurolink generate "This is faster speech" \
  --provider google-ai \
  --tts-voice en-US-Neural2-C \
  --tts-speed 1.5
```

### Pitch Adjustment

Adjust voice pitch (-20.0 to 20.0 semitones):

```typescript
// Lower pitch (deeper voice)
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  pitch: -5.0
}

// Normal pitch (default)
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  pitch: 0.0  // Default
}

// Higher pitch
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  pitch: 5.0
}
```

**CLI:**

```bash
neurolink generate "Higher pitch test" \
  --provider google-ai \
  --tts-voice en-US-Neural2-C \
  --tts-pitch 3.0
```

### Volume Adjustment

Control output volume (-96.0 to 16.0 dB):

```typescript
tts: {
  voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  volumeGainDb: 0.0  // Default (no change)
}
```

## Use Cases & Examples

### 1. Voice Assistant

Create a voice assistant that speaks responses:

```typescript
const assistant = new NeuroLink();

const response = await assistant.generate({
  input: { text: "What's the weather like today?" },
  provider: "google-ai",
  tts: {
    enabled: true,
    useAiResponse: true, // Speak AI's weather response
    voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
    play: true,
  },
});

// AI generates weather info and speaks it
```

### 2. Accessibility Features

Screen reader-style narration for visually impaired users:

```typescript
const narration = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "Button clicked. Navigation menu opened." },
  provider: "google-ai",
  tts: {
    enabled: true,
    voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
    speed: 1.2, // Slightly faster for efficiency
    play: true,
  },
});
```

### 3. Podcast Generation

Generate professional podcast intros:

```bash
neurolink generate "Welcome to Tech Insights Podcast, episode 42. Today we're discussing the future of AI development." \
  --provider google-ai \
  --tts-voice en-US-Wavenet-D \
  --tts-speed 0.95 \
  --tts-format mp3 \
  --tts-output podcast-intro.mp3
```

### 4. Language Learning

```bash
# Slow French pronunciation
neurolink generate "Je m'appelle Claude. Comment allez-vous?" \
  --provider google-ai \
  --tts-voice fr-FR-Neural2-A \
  --tts-speed 0.7 \
  --tts-output french-slow.mp3

# Normal speed for comparison
neurolink generate "Je m'appelle Claude. Comment allez-vous?" \
  --provider google-ai \
  --tts-voice fr-FR-Neural2-A \
  --tts-speed 1.0 \
  --tts-output french-normal.mp3
```

### 5. Multilingual Support

Generate audio in multiple languages:

```typescript
const translations = {
  english: {
    text: "Hello, welcome to our application.",
    voice: "en-US-Neural2-C",
  },
  french: {
    text: "Bonjour, bienvenue dans notre application.",
    voice: "fr-FR-Wavenet-A",
  },
  spanish: {
    text: "Hola, bienvenido a nuestra aplicación.",
    voice: "es-ES-Neural2-A",
  },
  hindi: {
    text: "नमस्ते, हमारे एप्लिकेशन में आपका स्वागत है।",
    voice: "hi-IN-Wavenet-A",
  },
};

for (const [lang, config] of Object.entries(translations)) {
  const result = await neurolink.generate({
    input: { text: config.text },
    provider: "google-ai",
    tts: {
      enabled: true,
      voice: config.voice,
      format: "mp3",
      output: `welcome-${lang}.mp3`,
    },
  });
  console.log(`Generated ${lang} audio (${result.audio?.size} bytes)`);
}
```

### 6. Batch Audio Generation

Generate multiple audio files efficiently:

```typescript
async function generateBatchAudio(
  texts: string[],
  voice: string = "en-US-Neural2-C",
) {
  const results = [];

  for (const text of texts) {
    const result = await neurolink.generate({
      input: { text },
      provider: "google-ai",
      tts: {
        enabled: true,
        voice,
        format: "mp3",
      },
    });

    results.push({
      text,
      audioBuffer: result.audio?.buffer,
      audioSize: result.audio?.size,
    });
  }

  return results;
}

// Usage
const audioFiles = await generateBatchAudio([
  "Welcome to our application.",
  "Please enter your username and password.",
  "Login successful. Redirecting to dashboard.",
]);

// Save all files
audioFiles.forEach((item, index) => {
  if (item.audioBuffer) {
    writeFileSync(`audio-${index}.mp3`, item.audioBuffer);
  }
});
```

### 7. Streaming Text + Audio

Mode 2 can synthesize sentence-buffered audio while the text response is still
streaming. `stream()` synthesizes whenever `tts.enabled` is set;
`useAiResponse` selects input-versus-response synthesis for `generate()` and
does not apply to `stream()`. `streamingBufferSize` sets the minimum number of
buffered characters before a completed sentence is flushed (default: 120). A
provider's `maxTextLength` remains a hard boundary; handlers without an override
use the 3,000-character default.

Handlers can optionally expose provider-native audio reads for each buffered
text segment. NeuroLink prefers that capability when it supports the requested
options and otherwise keeps the existing one-buffer-per-segment synthesis path.
Custom and built-in handlers without the optional capability remain compatible.

Two handlers currently offer it, each only for the options whose incremental
delivery has been verified against the live API:

| Handler      | Streams natively for                                                                    | Everything else    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `openai-tts` | `mp3`, `pcm16`                                                                          | buffered synthesis |
| `google-ai`  | `pcm16` and `ogg`/`opus`, **and** only for a `Chirp3-HD`, `Chirp-HD` or `Journey` voice | buffered synthesis |

Google's restriction is the streaming endpoint's own, not NeuroLink's: it
rejects every other voice family (`Neural2`, `Studio`, `Wavenet`, `Standard`)
with `only Chirp 3: HD voices are supported for streaming synthesis`, and
rejects `MP3` and `LINEAR16` as unsupported encodings even though
`synthesizeSpeech` accepts both. SSML is also excluded — the streaming request
has no SSML field at all, so `<speak>` input stays on the buffered path rather
than being sent as literal text. Because the default format is `mp3` and the
default voice is a `Neural2` one, native streaming is strictly opt-in: pass
both a streaming-capable voice and `format: "pcm16"` (or `"ogg"`) to get it.

```typescript
// Sentence-buffered audio arrives in many reads instead of one per sentence.
const streamResult = await neurolink.stream({
  input: { text: "Summarize the quarterly report." },
  tts: {
    enabled: true,
    provider: "google-ai",
    voice: "en-US-Chirp3-HD-Aoede",
    format: "pcm16",
  },
});
```

Note that `pcm16` is headerless: the chunks report `sampleRate: 24000` so a
consumer can wrap them, and Google's buffered path does not support `pcm16` at
all, so that format only works for the streaming-capable voices above.

Provider-local chunk indexes and finality are not exposed directly. NeuroLink
recomputes a single global zero-based index, cumulative byte size, and exactly
one final chunk across all successful segments. Empty transport reads on the
native path are dropped and never reach the consumer; the buffered path is
unchanged and forwards whatever a handler's `synthesize()` returns, so a handler
that answers with a zero-byte buffer still produces an empty chunk and a
repeated cumulative size, exactly as it did before native streaming existed.
Each read is forwarded as soon as the next one arrives — the single one-chunk
hold is what guarantees the final flag — rather than waiting for the segment to
complete. A handler that declines the capability for a segment, or that fails while
NeuroLink is still working out whether the capability is there, falls back to
buffered synthesis for that segment rather than leaving a gap — as does a
native stream that completes without producing any audio. That covers every
step of the question, reads as well as calls, since reading a property can run
a getter or a proxy trap that throws: reading `synthesizeStream`, a member that
is not callable, reading or calling `isConfigured`, the call itself throwing,
and a returned value that is not async-iterable (its `Symbol.asyncIterator`
being unreadable included). A throwing `isConfigured` falls back the same way
but then fails on the buffered path as well — shaped, exactly as it would for a
handler with no native member. A handler that simply reports itself unconfigured
is not in that list: that segment fails with `TTS_PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED`,
exactly as it did before native streaming existed. Once the segment's own work
begins — at the `[Symbol.asyncIterator]()` call — an error fails that segment
like any other synthesis failure, and its audio is not re-fetched through the
buffered path.
If a stream consumer exits
early, cancellation reaches an active native request rather than waiting for the
pending response-body read to finish, and the segment that was in flight still
records its `tts.synthesize` span.

If one segment fails, NeuroLink keeps the text stream and already-yielded audio,
attempts the remaining segments, and resolves `streamResult.audio` from the
surviving chunks. After the stream is drained, `streamResult.ttsMetadata` reports
`success: false` and a structured, sanitized `error` identifying the failed
segment count and positions. The first segment failure supplies the error detail.

```typescript
async function streamAndSpeak(prompt: string, voice: string) {
  const streamResult = await neurolink.stream({
    input: { text: prompt },
    provider: "google-ai",
    model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    tts: {
      enabled: true,
      provider: "google-ai",
      voice,
      streamingBufferSize: 80,
    },
  });

  let fullText = "";
  for await (const chunk of streamResult.stream) {
    if ("content" in chunk) {
      fullText += chunk.content;
      process.stdout.write(chunk.content);
    } else if ("type" in chunk && chunk.type === "tts_audio") {
      // Chunks are ordered by index. cumulativeSize grows monotonically,
      // and exactly the last successful audio chunk has isFinal=true.
      playAudioChunk(chunk.audio.data);
    }
  }

  // After stream iteration, audio resolves to the concatenated TTS result.
  // Native OpenAI mp3/pcm16 chunks are transport fragments: consume them in
  // order or use this aggregate; an individual fragment need not be playable.
  // Buffered providers still contribute one complete buffer per text segment.
  // Concatenating those segment buffers produces one playable stream for
  // mp3/mpeg/mpga/pcm16, but NOT a valid file for header-bearing containers
  // (wav, flac, m4a, mp4, webm), and a chained stream for ogg/opus that some
  // decoders read only through its first segment.
  return {
    text: fullText,
    audio: await streamResult.audio,
  };
}

// Usage
const result = await streamAndSpeak(
  "Explain quantum computing in simple terms",
  "en-US-Neural2-C",
);
```

The buffering heuristic recognizes `.`, `!`, or `?` followed by whitespace or
the end of a text chunk. Short sentences remain buffered until the configured
boundary or stream completion. Text without sentence punctuation is hard-split
at the provider limit, so repeated synthesis calls never exceed that cap. The
same chunk ordering and finality rules apply when a provider falls back to
synthetic streaming.

## Error Handling

### Common Error Patterns

```typescript
async function generateTTSWithRetry(
  text: string,
  voice: string,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
) {
  let lastError: Error | undefined;

  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const result = await neurolink.generate({
        input: { text },
        provider: "google-ai",
        tts: {
          enabled: true,
          voice,
          format: "mp3",
        },
      });

      // Validate audio buffer
      if (!result.audio || result.audio.size === 0) {
        throw new Error("Empty audio buffer received");
      }

      return {
        success: true,
        audio: result.audio,
        attempt,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error as Error;
      console.error(`Attempt ${attempt} failed:`, error.message);

      // Don't retry on invalid input
      if (
        error.message.includes("invalid voice") ||
        error.message.includes("text too long")
      ) {
        break;
      }

      // Exponential backoff
      if (attempt < maxRetries) {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * attempt));
      }
    }
  }

  return {
    success: false,
    error: lastError?.message || "Unknown error occurred",
    attempts: maxRetries,
  };
}

// Usage
const result = await generateTTSWithRetry(
  "Generate this with retry logic",
  "en-US-Neural2-C",
);

if (result.success && result.audio) {
  console.log("Success!");
  writeFileSync("output.mp3", result.audio.buffer);
} else {
  console.error("Failed:", result.error);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                            | Cause                    | Solution                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"TTS client not initialized"** | Missing credentials      | Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`                                  |
| **"Invalid voice name"**         | Voice ID not found       | Check the [Google Cloud TTS voice list](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices) |
| **"Text too long"**              | Input exceeds 5000 bytes | Split text into smaller chunks                                                               |
| **"Synthesis failed"**           | Network/API error        | Check network connection and credentials                                                     |
| **Audio doesn't play**           | Missing audio player     | Install `afplay` (macOS), `ffplay` (Linux), or use WAV on Windows                            |
| **Empty audio buffer**           | API returned no content  | Check API quota and retry                                                                    |

### Authentication Issues

**Service Account:**

```bash
# Verify credentials file exists
ls -la $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

# Test authentication
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**API Key:**

```bash
# Verify API key is set
echo $GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
```

### Audio Playback Issues

**macOS:**

- `afplay` is pre-installed, supports all formats
- If playback fails, check system volume settings

**Linux:**

- Install `ffmpeg` for full format support: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
- Alternative: Use `aplay` for WAV files only

**Windows:**

- Built-in playback only supports WAV
- Install VLC or Windows Media Player for other formats
- SDK auto-converts to WAV when `play: true` on Windows

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cache voices** - Voice list is cached for 5 minutes
2. **Batch processing** - Group multiple TTS requests when possible
3. **Use appropriate quality** - Standard voices are faster and cheaper
4. **Optimize text length** - Keep under 5000 bytes per request

### Production Deployment

1. **Use service accounts** - More secure than API keys
2. **Implement retry logic** - Handle transient network failures
3. **Monitor quota usage** - Track Google Cloud TTS API usage
4. **Set appropriate timeouts** - Default is 30 seconds
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide fallback behavior

### Voice Selection

1. **Test before deploying** - Different voices suit different use cases
2. **Match gender to persona** - Choose appropriate gender for your application
3. **Consider language variants** - `en-US` vs `en-GB` vs `en-IN`
4. **Use Neural2 for quality** - Best natural-sounding voices

### Cost Management

1. **Use Standard voices** - For high-volume, non-critical use cases
2. **Cache generated audio** - Avoid regenerating the same content
3. **Monitor API usage** - Set budget alerts in Google Cloud Console
