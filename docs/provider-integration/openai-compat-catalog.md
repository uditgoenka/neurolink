# OpenAI-Compatible Provider Catalog

Every OpenAI-compatible provider in the catalog (80 as of 2026-09-29; the
directory is the list) is registered from **one JSON file each**, under
`src/lib/providers/catalog/<id>.json`, and served by one generic class,
`ConfiguredOpenAICompatProvider`
(`src/lib/providers/configuredOpenAICompat.ts`). Adding another provider to
this family means adding one JSON file — no subclass, no registry edit, no
hand-written enum member, no test edit.

## The JSON is the source of truth

`OPENAI_COMPAT_CATALOG` still exists and keeps its name and element type,
but it is now _built_ by the loader (`src/lib/providers/catalog/loader.ts`)
from the JSON files rather than hand-written. Two consumers read the JSON:

- **Codegen** (`pnpm run codegen:catalog`) writes the compile-time
  artifacts into marked regions — the `AIProviderName` member, the
  `<Name>Models` enum, the `NeurolinkCredentials` key — plus the generated
  index. Pre-commit and CI fail on stale output.
- **The loader** builds the runtime entry; the descriptor, config options,
  context windows, pricing, vision map and model-choice tables all derive
  from it, as do the provider test suites' rows and counts.

Each file is validated by a zod schema (`src/lib/providers/catalog/schema.ts`)
with a mirrored `provider-catalog.schema.json` for editor squiggles.
Probe evidence (roster/auth/billing dates, live-matrix result, PR URL)
lives in the file's `evidence` block — the old
`docs/provider-integration/manifests/<id>.json` files were folded into it.

Field-by-field reference and the escape hatches:
`tiers/tier-2-catalog-entry.md`. Design rationale and the approved rulings:
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-28-provider-json-catalog-spec.md`.

## When a provider belongs in the catalog

A provider belongs in the JSON catalog if it needs **only**:

- a credential (API key, optionally an extra field like Cloudflare's account id)
- a base URL (static default + optional env override, or computed from an
  extra credential field)
- a default/fallback model
- error-message classification (auth / rate-limit / invalid-model / generic)
- a named, closed catalog quirk. DeepSeek is the worked example: it 400s on
  `json_schema` structured-output requests, so `deepseek.json` sets
  `quirks.responseFormatDowngrade: "json-schema-to-json-object"` and the
  generic `ConfiguredOpenAICompatProvider` downgrades to `json_object` before
  sending — no subclass. It also sets `quirks.replayReasoningContent: true`:
  DeepSeek documents that each assistant turn's `reasoning_content` must go
  back on later requests once tools are in play, so the shared message
  converter and the streaming tool loop send it — for this quirk only, since
  strict OpenAI-compatible backends reject the unknown field.
- a wire-proven capability such as
  `capabilities.structuredOutputWithTools`. The generic provider suppresses
  `response_format` when tools are attached by default; an explicit `true`
  keeps it on the same `generate()` or `stream()` request. Set this only after
  a combined tools-plus-schema request returned successfully. Separate tool
  and structured-output probes are not evidence for the combined capability.
  A stale opt-in is still protected by the runtime conflict retry, which drops
  structured output and retries rather than losing the turn.

The currently opted-in providers are Baseten, DeepSeek, Fireworks AI, GMI
Cloud, Inception Labs, io.net Intelligence, Novita AI, Together AI, Upstage and
xAI. API Route remains opted out because its evidence verifies the features
separately, not together in one request. Mistral remains opted out because its
combined probes returned 429 twice, not a successful capability response.

## When a provider needs a dedicated subclass instead

Azure OpenAI is deliberately **not** in the catalog because it overrides real
request-shaping behavior that no named catalog quirk expresses:

- **Azure OpenAI** (`src/lib/providers/azureOpenai.ts`) overrides four hooks:
  `getChatCompletionsURL` (deployment-name URL routing across two Azure
  endpoint schemes), `getAuthHeaders` (Azure's `api-key` header instead of
  `Authorization: Bearer`), `adjustRequestBody` (renames `max_tokens` to
  `max_completion_tokens` for o-series/gpt-5+ deployments), and
  `suppressResponseFormatWithTools` (Azure supports both at once).

If a future provider needs any hook beyond the 3 mandatory ones
(`getProviderName`, `getDefaultModel`, `formatProviderError`) or the 2
purely-declarative optional ones (`getFallbackModelName`,
`getFallbackModels`) and that hook is not already a named catalog quirk, it
needs either a new closed quirk (the DeepSeek route) or a dedicated subclass
(the Azure OpenAI route).

## Error-message fidelity

Each entry's `errorRules` is a direct, order-preserving translation of its
original subclass's `formatProviderError` `if`/`else` ladder into rule data
(status code and/or case-insensitive pattern), classified via
`classifyProviderError()`
(`src/lib/utils/errorClassifier.ts`). Every bespoke message string is
preserved verbatim — including xAI's "top up your account" quota URL and
Groq's decommissioned-vs-not-found distinction — via each rule's own
`message` field (`string | ((ctx) => string)`), with model-name
interpolation carried through `ctx.modelName`. There is no message-wording
regression here. Timeout classification is likewise unchanged: 15 of the 16
providers map `TimeoutError` to `NetworkError` (the classifier's default),
and Groq alone maps it to `ProviderError`. Groq's subclass override is
preserved verbatim via the JSON's `quirks.timeoutErrorClass`, so no
provider's timeout class changed during migration.

## Known pre-existing quirk this migration preserved (not fixed)

Mistral's provider registration passes a `defaultModel` value to
`ProviderFactory.registerProvider()` that does **not** check `MISTRAL_MODEL`
(`MistralModels.MISTRAL_LARGE_LATEST`, a bare literal), while
`ConfiguredOpenAICompatProvider.getDefaultModel()` for Mistral **does**
check `MISTRAL_MODEL` (falling back to `MistralModels.MISTRAL_SMALL_2506`).
Every other catalog provider's registry default and class default agree.
This is expressed via the JSON's `quirks.registryDefaultIgnoresModelEnvVar`
(`true` only for Mistral). The JSON migration did reconcile one half of it:
`getDefaultModel(MISTRAL)` now returns the real generation default
(`mistral-small-2506`) rather than the registry literal — a disclosed
bug-fix-grade delta, since the two disagreed before.

## What comes next

The credential-free growth queue in `docs/provider-integration/growth-queue.json` lists every
verified candidate vendor by wave (W1 = hosted OpenAI-compatible, the catalog path). Entries
onboarded from it carry `evidence.liveMatrix: null` until a live run with a real key.
